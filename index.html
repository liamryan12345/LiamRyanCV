    <h1 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align:center; font-size: 36px;">Education:</h1>
    <p><strong>2nd Year International Business Management</strong><br>
    Cardiff University (Graduating 2028, Placement Year commencing 06/2026)
    <br>I attained a 66% average grade in first year and am keen to bolster that percentage. My degree now has a strong emphasis on Inferential Statistics, Statistical Modelling and Survey Methods as well as International Management. Throughout the course of my University career, I have gained theoretical knowledge pertaining to my course but also the skills and tools to independently actualize theoretical understanding of topics into tangible results (for instance this webpage was made through research skills and initiative I have cultivated in University in conjunction with information from the internet).
     <p><strong>Sir William Borlase Grammer School </strong><br>
     SWBGS is the Grammer School I attended from Yeaer 7 through to year 13 where I studied British and American Politics, Businessand and English Literature in addition to an EPQ pertaining to enviromental and sustainable practices relating to the fashion industry.
     <p><strong>Hoshuko (Japanese International School) </strong><br>
      Whilst I grew up in the UK outside of London, I attended Hoshuko, an international school for Japanese nationals which on Saturday teaches British nationals Japanese. This allowed me an excellent perspective on a prospective multicultural organization and has imprinted a fundamental open mindedness throughout my entire life. Through this, I was able to acquire a 9 in Japanese GCSE in addition to my other GCSEs.

    <h1 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align:center; font-size: 36px;"> Professional Experience:</h1>
    <p><strong>Avoke Ltd.</strong><br>
    Marlow, Buckinghamshire (09/23 - 03/24)<br>
    Avoke Ltd. is one of the biggest Audio Visual equipment distributors operating primarily in the UK but has on occasion worked internationally. Initially, my day to day responsibility within the organization was administrative which acted as extremely formative insight into the inner-workings of a business, something which has intrigued and captivated me since. 
    Through having this oppurtunity, I was able to gain a proffeciency in Microsoft Excel as well as Zoho (a CRM system) and how the two can and should interact. <br>
   <p><strong>Vintage Clothes Curator	</strong><br>
    Cardiff/London/Tokyo (10/24 - Present)<br>
    Through a keen eye; knowledge of the contemporary fashion zeitgeist and a degree of patience, I have successfully commodified my interest in fashion by curating desirable garments and selling them for profit. This endeavour has spanned both the UK and Tokyo. In doing so, I have been able to supplement myself financially throughout University and hope to establish an online retail store by the end of 2025.
   <P><strong>Rift Promotion</strong><br>
     London/Cardiff (02/25 - Present)<br>
     A music promotion company I have had a minor role in where I have appropriately matched various acts based on the segmentation of prospective listeners and the location of events as well as creating virtual promotional material. Through this role, I have greatly benefited in applying theoretical marketing ideas into practice and learning from failures and successes alike.
    <p><strong>St Jamess' Place</strong><br>
    Virtual work experience day								(02/06/25)<br>
    I was fortunate enough to be admitted into a virtual work experience day with St James’ place - the largest wealth management firm in the UK by assets under management (AUM).Through this oppurtunity, I was fortunate enough to gain insight into the world of financial managment
   <p><strong>Employment (various)</strong><br>
    Miscellaneous (2018 - 2025)<br>
    Throughout my adolescence, I have consistently been in the workforce since 2018 (aged 14) having only recently been not involved in the workforce since starting my second year of University in September of 2025. In this time, I have been in hospitality; bartending for 3 years where I have honed my social awareness, interpersonal and conversational skills through interacting with thousands of diverse customers, colleagues and figures of authority. I have also gained a profound appreciation and enjoyment of meeting a mosaic of different people on the national, religious and socioeconomic level. I have additionally worked roles in labouring (although negligible in regards to transferable skills that would be redundant to mention other than an entrenchment of a generalised work ethic).
